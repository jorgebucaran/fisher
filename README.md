## Installation

```console
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jorgebucaran/fisher/main/functions/fisher.fish | source && fisher install jorgebucaran/fisher
```

## Quickstart

Fisher lets you install, update, and remove plugins like a boss. Revel in Fish's [tab completion](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/index.html#completion) and rich syntax highlighting while you're at it.

### Installing plugins

To install plugins, use the `install` command and point it to the GitHub repository.

```console
fisher install jorgebucaran/nvm.fish
```

> Wanna install from GitLab? No problemo—just prepend `gitlab.com/` to the plugin path.

You can also snag a specific version of a plugin by adding an `@` symbol after the plugin name, followed by a tag, branch, or [commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitglossary#Documentation/gitglossary.txt-aiddefcommit-ishacommit-ishalsocommittish).

```console
fisher install IlanCosman/tide@v5
```

And hey, you can install plugins from a local directory too!

```console
fisher install ~/path/to/plugin
```

> Heads up! Fisher expands plugins into your Fish configuration directory by default, overwriting existing files. If that's not your jam, set `$fisher_path` to your preferred location and put it in your function path ([#640](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher/issues/640)).

### Listing plugins

Use the `list` command to see all your shiny installed plugins.

```console
$ fisher list
jorgebucaran/fisher
ilancosman/tide@v5
jorgebucaran/nvm.fish
/home/jb/path/to/plugin
```

The `list` command also plays nice with regular expressions for filtering the output.

```console
$ fisher list \^/
/home/jb/path/to/plugin
```

### Updating plugins

`update` command to the rescue! It updates one or more plugins to their latest and greatest version.

```console
fisher update jorgebucaran/fisher
```

> Just type `fisher update` to update everything in one fell swoop.

### Removing plugins

Say goodbye to installed plugins with the `remove` command.

```console
fisher remove jorgebucaran/nvm.fish
```

Feeling destructive? Wipe out everything, including Fisher itself.

```console
fisher list | fisher remove
```

## Using your `fish_plugins` file

Whenever you install or remove a plugin from the command line, Fisher jots down all the installed plugins in `$__fish_config_dir/fish_plugins`. Add this file to your dotfiles or version control to easily share your configuration across different systems.

You can also edit this file and run `fisher update` to commit changes like a pro:

```console
$EDITOR $__fish_config_dir/fish_plugins
```

```diff
jorgebucaran/fisher
ilancosman/tide@v5
jorgebucaran/nvm.fish
+ PatrickF1/fzf.fish
- /home/jb/path/to/plugin
```

```console
fisher update
```

This will install **PatrickF1**/**fzf.fish**, remove /**home**/**jb**/**path**/**to**/**plugin**, and update everything else.

## Creating a plugin

Plugins can include any number of files in `functions`, `conf.d`, and `completions` directories. Most plugins are just a single function or a [configuration snippet](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/index.html#configuration). Behold the anatomy of a typical plugin:

<pre>
<b>flipper</b>
├── <b>completions</b>
│   └── flipper.fish
├── <b>conf.d</b>
│   └── flipper.fish
└── <b>functions</b>
    └── flipper.fish
</pre>

Non `.fish` files and directories inside these locations will be copied to `$fisher_path` under `functions`, `conf.d`, or `completions` respectively.

### Event system

Fisher notifies plugins when they're being installed, updated, or removed via [events](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/cmds/emit.html). Each relevant event handler is invoked with the plugin's name supplied as the first argument.

> Place your event handler functions in the `conf.d` directory to ensure they're loaded and ready when needed.

```fish
# Defined in flipper/conf.d/flipper.fish

function _flipper_install --on-event flipper_install --argument-names plugin
    # Set universal variables, create bindings, and other initialization logic.
end

function _flipper_update --on-event flipper_update --argument-names plugin
    # Migrate resources, print warnings, and other update logic.
end

function _flipper_uninstall --on-event flipper_uninstall --argument-names plugin
    # Erase "private" functions, variables, bindings, and other uninstall logic.
end
```

## Creating a theme

A theme is like any other Fish plugin, but with a `.theme` file in the `themes` directory. Themes were introduced in [Fish `3.4`](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/releases/tag/3.4.0) and work with the `fish_config` builtin. A theme can also have files in `functions`, `conf.d`, or `completions` if necessary. Check out what a typical theme plugin looks like:

<pre>
<b>gills</b>
├── <b>conf.d</b>
│   └── gills.fish
└── <b>themes</b>
    └── gills.theme
</pre>

### Using `$fisher_path` with themes

If you customize `$fisher_path` to use a directory other than `$__fish_config_dir`, your themes won't be available via `fish_config`. That's because Fish expects your themes to be in `$__fish_config_dir/themes`, not `$fisher_path/themes`. This isn't configurable in Fish yet, but there's [a request to add that feature](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9456).

Fear not! You can easily solve this by symlinking Fisher's `themes` directory into your Fish config. First, backup any existing themes directory.

```console
mv $__fish_config_dir/themes $__fish_config_dir/themes.bak
```

Next, create a symlink for Fisher's themes directory.

```console
ln -s $fisher_path/themes $__fish_config_dir/themes
```

Want to use theme plugins and maintain your own local themes? You can do that too ([#708](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher/issues/708)).

## Discoverability

While Fisher doesn't rely on a central plugin repository, discovering new plugins doesn't have to feel like navigating uncharted waters. To boost your plugin's visibility and make it easier for users to find, [add relevant topics to your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics#adding-topics-to-your-repository) using [`fish-plugin`](https://github.com/topics/fish-plugin). By doing so, you're not only contributing to the Fisher community but also enabling users to explore new plugins and enhance their Fish shell experience. Don't let plugin discovery be a fishy business, tag your plugins today!

## Acknowledgments

Fisher started its journey in 2016 by [@jorgebucaran](https://github.com/jorgebucaran) as a shell configuration manager for Fish. Along the way, many helped shape it into what it is today. [Oh My Fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish) paved the way as the first popular Fish framework. [@jethrokuan](https://github.com/jethrokuan) provided crucial support during the early years. [@PatrickF1](https://github.com/PatrickF1)'s candid feedback proved invaluable time and again. Bootstrapping Fisher was originally [@IlanCosman](https://github.com/IlanCosman)'s brilliant idea. Thank you to all our contributors! <3
